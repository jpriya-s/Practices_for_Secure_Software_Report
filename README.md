Using the latest static scan plugin, "dependency-check-maven," software security vulnerabilities are identified in the client's web application. This report helps to identify all the vulnerabilities with severities. Security vulnerabilities should be fixed with high priority as international users use the client's web application. If these security issues are not addressed, the application is vulnerable to hacking; the user's sensitive data will be compromised, and web application operations will not be available or malfunctioned.

Going through all the vulnerability issues and understanding each issue, impact, and the fix details is a little time-consuming but necessary to fix and can be avoided in the future application development code.

The application security layer can be increased by using authorization along with authentication and MFA. Vulnerabilities can be found by using static scan reports or manual code reviews. To fix each reported vulnerability, find the software version the issue is fixed and use it; if no fixes are available yet, suppress the vulnerability.

Once you fixed the issues, re-build, run the application and verify the functionalities are working fine. Also, generate scan reports and validate the security issue is fixed and that no new vulnerabilities are introduced with the new code.

The dependency check maven plugin helps identify security vulnerabilities in the application, and I will use this plugin in the future. Fixing each security issue gave me experience in developing secure code.

I can show this assignment to showcase my experience in identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in the application.
